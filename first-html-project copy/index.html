This second edition is fully updated to include ES7 (ECMAScript 7), the latest version of React Native (including Redux), and development on Android. You will start by setting up React Native and exploring the anatomy of React Native apps. You'll then move on to Redux data flow, how it differs from flux, and how you can include it in your React Native project to solve state management differently and efficiently. You will also learn how to boost your development by including popular packages developed by the React Native community that will help you write less; do more. Finally, you'll learn to how write test cases using Jest and submit your application to the App Store. React Native challenges the status quo of native iOS and Android development with revolutionary components, asynchronous execution, unique methods for touch handling, and much more. This book reveals the the path-breaking concepts of React.js and acquaints you with the React way of thinking so you can learn to create stunning user interfaces. What You'll Learn Build stunning iOS and Android applications Understand the Redux design pattern and use it in your project Interact with iOS and android device capabilities such as addressbook, camera, GPS and more with your apps Test and launch your application to the App StoreWho This Book Is For Anyone with JavaScript experience who wants to build native mobile applications but dreads the thought of programming in Objective-C or Java.

            <p>Get a practical introduction to React Native, the JavaScript framework for writing and deploying fully featured mobile apps that render natively. The second edition of this hands-on guide shows you how to build applications that target iOS, Android, and other mobile platforms instead of browsers—apps that can access platform features such as the camera, user location, and local storage. Through code examples and step-by-step instructions, web developers and frontend engineers familiar with React will learn how to build and style interfaces, use mobile components, and debug and deploy apps. You’ll learn how to extend React Native using third-party libraries or your own Java and Objective-C libraries. Understand how React Native works under the hood with native UI components Examine how React Native’s mobile-based components compare to basic HTML elements Create and style your own React Native components and applications Take advantage of platform-specific APIs, as well as modules from the framework’s community Incorporate platform-specific components into cross-platform apps Learn common pitfalls of React Native development, and tools for dealing with them Combine a large application’s many screens into a cohesive UX Handle state management in a large app with the Redux library</p>
